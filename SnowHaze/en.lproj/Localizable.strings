We wanted to take a minute to say thank you and tell you about our upcoming projects.\n\nIt's been quite some time since SnowHaze first came to life on July 27th in 2016. This is already version 2.5 of SnowHaze and a whole lot has changed since version 1.0. The launch of our ultra-private search engine and our own no-log VPN service are just two examples.\n\nWe are very thankful for having you on board with us on our mission to make the internet a more secure and private place. It is only because of our amazing user base like you that we can do the things we love.\n\nWe want to help as many people make their lives more private as possible, and that’s why we stay in touch with hundreds of people every week, answering their questions and freely sharing advice.\n\nThat’s why we’re obsessed with creating more and better products and services, and why we value your feedback so much.\n\nThat's why SnowHaze is now fully open source.\n\nAnd that’s why we’re going to be taking everything to another level this year, starting with the launch of SnowHaze for Android, a macOS VPN client, and much more! More on this will follow soon!\n\nIt is important for us to keep in touch with our users. You are our inspiration and our motivation to get up in the morning and push SnowHaze. If you like what we are doing, tell your friends, family, and the random guy/lady on the street about SnowHaze and our mission. The more we are, the louder our voice is. If there is something you don't like, then definitely shoot us an e-mail and we will get back to you as soon as possible.\n\nBest,\nJan, Yvan, Dominique, Andris, Pascal\nThe founders of SnowHaze\n\nBtw. This message was hard-coded and did not require any connection to any servers :) We really do care about your privacy (:\n";
